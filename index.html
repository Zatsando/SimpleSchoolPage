                The Coding School is a 501(c)(3) organization that aims to empower the next generation through computer
                science education. Founded by a Brown University undergraduate in 2014, The Coding School has grown into
                an international organization with 600+ instructors and students from over 10 countries participating in
                our programs. To ensure our programming and teaching is of the highest quality, we’re partnered with a

                Engineering, Brown University, and Villanova University.
